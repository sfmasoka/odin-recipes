    <p>
      A green bean casserole makes the Thanksgiving holiday complete, and this
      version can be on the table in no time at all thanks to just four
      ingredients from your pantry or fridge: canned green beans, condensed
      mushroom soup, French-fried onions, and shredded Cheddar cheese.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans green beans, drained</li>
      <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
      <li>1 (6 ounce) can French-fried onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix the beans and soup in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave until
        warm.
      </li>
      <li>Stir in half the cheese. Microwave until melted and well-blended.</li>
      <li>
        Transfer to a prepared baking dish. Top with fried onions and remaining
        cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
